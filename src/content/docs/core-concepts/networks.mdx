# Networks

## Overview

DeanMachines uses a distributed network architecture to connect and coordinate multiple agents. This section covers the core concepts of networks in DeanMachines.

## Network Types

### Local Network
- Runs on a single machine
- Ideal for development and testing
- Limited scalability

### Distributed Network
- Runs across multiple machines
- Supports horizontal scaling
- Requires proper configuration for high availability

### Cloud Network
- Runs on cloud infrastructure
- Automatic scaling capabilities
- Enterprise-grade security features

## Network Components

### Network Coordinator
- Manages communication between agents
- Handles message routing
- Monitors network health

### Message Bus
- Provides reliable message delivery
- Supports various communication protocols
- Handles message queuing and persistence

### Network Policies
- Defines communication rules
- Controls data flow
- Implements security measures

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate network type based on your needs
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Monitor network performance
4. Regularly update network configuration
5. Follow security guidelines

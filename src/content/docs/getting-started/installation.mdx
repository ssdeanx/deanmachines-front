# Installation

This guide will help you set up your development environment for working with DeanMachines AI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18.x or later
- pnpm 8.x or later (recommended) or npm 9.x
- A code editor (we recommend VS Code)
- Git for version control

## Quick Installation

The fastest way to get started is using our CLI:

```bash
pnpm add @deanmachines/cli -g
deanmachines init my-ai-project
cd my-ai-project
pnpm install
```

## Core Packages

Install the core packages for your project:

```bash
pnpm add @deanmachines/core @deanmachines/client-js @deanmachines/memory
```

### Optional Packages

Depending on your needs, you might want to install additional packages:

```bash
# For voice capabilities
pnpm add @deanmachines/voice-openai

# For advanced memory management
pnpm add @deanmachines/memory-pg

# For deployment
pnpm add @deanmachines/deployer
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
DEANMACHINES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DEANMACHINES_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

<Callout>
  Get your API key and project ID from the [DeanMachines AI Dashboard](https://dashboard.deanmachines.ai).
</Callout>

## IDE Setup

We recommend using Visual Studio Code with the following extensions:

- Mastra AI Tools
- TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
- ESLint
- Prettier

## Verifying Installation

Test your installation by creating a simple agent:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@deanmachines/core'

const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'test-agent',
  description: 'A test agent'
})

console.log('Agent created:', agent.id)
```

Run the test:

```bash
pnpm tsx test.ts
```

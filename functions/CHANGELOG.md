## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Comprehensive evals toolset in `tools/evals.ts` with SigNoz tracing: includes completeness, answer relevancy, content similarity, context precision, context position, tone consistency, keyword coverage, textual difference, faithfulness, and token count metrics.
- All eval tools output normalized scores, explanations, and are ready for agent/workflow integration.
- LlamaIndex tool output schema and type safety improvements.

### Changed

- Integrated SigNoz tracing into all eval tools and reinforced tracing in agent and tool workflows.
- Updated RL Trainer agent config and tool registration for robust RL workflows.
- Updated tool barrel (`tools/index.ts`) to ensure all schemas and tools are exported only once and are available for agent configs.

### Fixed

- Removed all duplicate schema/tool exports in `wikibase.ts`, `wikidata-client.ts`, `github.ts`, `llamaindex.ts`, and `evals.ts`.
- Fixed throttle type mismatches and replaced unsupported string methods for broader TypeScript compatibility.

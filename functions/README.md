## Key Concepts

- **Agent**: An autonomous LLM-powered entity with a specific configuration, memory, and toolset.
- **Tool**: A modular function (search, eval, RL, etc.) that agents can call to augment their capabilities.
- **Memory**: Persistent storage for agent conversations, context, and semantic recall.
- **Model Provider**: Abstraction for LLM backends (Google, Vertex AI, OpenAI, etc.).
- **Observability**: Integrated tracing and metrics via SigNoz and OpenTelemetry.

```

---

## Agent Types

Agents are defined in `src/mastra/agents/` and configured via TypeScript config files. Each agent has:

- A unique `id`, `name`, and `description`
- A `modelConfig` specifying the LLM provider/model (see `config.types.ts`)
- A set of `toolIds` (referencing tools in the registry)
- Optional response validation and error handling hooks
- Example agents: `rlTrainer.agent.ts`, `research.agent.ts`, `writer.agent.ts`, `coder.agent.ts`, etc.
- RL Trainer Agent is specialized for feedback collection, analysis, and policy optimization (see `rlTrainer.agent.ts` and `rlTrainer.config.ts`)

---

## Tooling System

Tools are modular, reusable functions that agents can invoke. They are defined in `src/mastra/tools/` and registered in the main tool barrel (`tools/index.ts`).

- **Types of Tools:**
  - Search: Brave, Google, Tavily, Exa, Bing, etc.
  - RL Feedback & Reward: collect, analyze, optimize
  - Evals: completeness, relevancy, faithfulness, context precision, etc. (Vertex LLM + heuristics)
  - Content & Document: formatting, embedding, summarization
  - Utility: calculator, file I/O, GitHub, GraphRag, etc.
- **Tool Registration:**
  - All tools are registered and discoverable via `allTools`, `allToolsMap`, and `toolGroups` in `tools/index.ts`.
  - Output schemas are patched for type safety using `ensureToolOutputSchema`.
  - Extra tools (e.g., getMainBranchRef) are separated from core tools for clarity.
- **Adding a Tool:**
  - Implement the tool in `tools/`
  - Import and register in `tools/index.ts`
  - Patch output schema if needed
  - Add toolId to agent config as needed

---

## Memory & Database

- **LibSQL** is used for persistent memory storage and vector search (see `database/index.ts`).
- **Redis** is available for caching and fast key-value operations.
- **Memory** is injected into agents for context recall and thread management (see `sharedMemory` in `database/index.ts`).
- **MemoryConfig** allows tuning of lastMessages, semanticRecall, workingMemory, and thread title generation.

---

## Observability & Tracing

- **SigNoz** and **OpenTelemetry** are integrated for distributed tracing and metrics (see `services/signoz.ts` and `services/tracing.ts`).
- All tools and agents create spans for major operations.
- Latency, token usage, and error status are recorded for all LLM and tool calls.
- Tracing hooks are injected into agent lifecycle (see `base.agent.ts`).

---

## Model Providers

- **Google** and **Vertex AI** are the primary LLM providers (see `agents/config/model.utils.ts`).
- Model instantiation is abstracted via utility functions (`createGoogleModel`, `createVertexModel`, etc.).
- Provider configuration is managed in `provider.utils.ts`.
- Model selection is configurable via environment variables and agent configs.
- Default models and capabilities are defined in `config.types.ts`.

---

## Eval & RL Pipeline

- **Eval tools** (in `tools/evals.ts`) are production-grade, using Vertex AI for LLM-based scoring and robust fallback heuristics.
- **RL Feedback tools** (in `tools/rlFeedback.ts`) collect, analyze, and apply feedback for agent improvement.
- All evals and RL tools output latency, model, and token usage for observability.
- RL Trainer agent uses a structured methodology for observation, hypothesis, experimentation, analysis, implementation, and validation.

---

## Vertex AI & LLM Integration Details

- **Vertex AI is integrated using the @ai-sdk/google-vertex package.**
- **Model instantiation:**
  - Use `createVertexModel(modelId, projectId?, location?, options?)` from `src/mastra/agents/config/model.utils.ts`.
  - Example: `const model = createVertexModel("models/gemini-2.0-pro");`
- **Text generation:**
  - Use the `generateText` function from the `ai` package (aliased as `import { generateText } from "ai";`).
  - Example usage in a tool:

    ```typescript
    const result = await generateText({
      model,
      messages: [
        { role: "user", content: prompt }
      ]
    });
    ```

  - The result contains `.text` (the LLM output) and `.usage` (token counts, etc).
- **Prompting:**
  - Prompts are constructed with clear instructions and a request for JSON output.
  - Always parse the LLM output as JSON, and fallback to heuristics if parsing fails.
- **Model/config override:**
  - The model ID and config can be overridden via environment variables or tool input.
- **LLM output schema:**
  - All eval tools output: `score`, `explanation`, `latencyMs`, `model`, `tokens`, `success`, and `error` (if any).

---

## Development & Conventions

- **TypeScript** is used throughout for type safety and maintainability.
- **Zod** is used for schema validation of tool inputs/outputs.
- **Changelog** is maintained in `CHANGELOG.md` with semantic versioning.
- **Testing**: (Add your test strategy here if applicable)
- **Coding Standards**: Follow Mastra and DeanMachines conventions for modularity, error handling, and observability.
- **Windows OS**: This workspace is developed and tested on Windows (see context section).

---

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed history of changes, releases, and improvements.

## Notes for AI Assistants

- **Workspace Context:** This is a TypeScript monorepo for backend AI agent orchestration, using Mastra as the core framework. All agent, tool, and memory logic is in `src/mastra/`.
- **Tool Registration:** Always register new tools in `tools/index.ts` and patch output schemas. Use `ensureToolOutputSchema` for type safety.
- **Agent Configs:** Agent configs are in `agents/` and use the `BaseAgentConfig` type. RL Trainer agent is a canonical example.
- **Memory:** Use `sharedMemory` from `database/index.ts` for agent memory. Memory is LibSQL-backed and supports semantic recall.
- **Tracing:** All major operations should create spans using SigNoz or OpenTelemetry. See `services/signoz.ts` for span helpers.
- **Model Providers:** Use `createGoogleModel` or `createVertexModel` for LLM instantiation. Model configs are in `config.types.ts`.
- **Eval Tools:** Use Vertex LLM for evals, fallback to heuristics if LLM fails. Always output latency, model, and tokens.
- **Windows:** Paths and scripts may use Windows conventions.
- **Mermaid Diagrams:** Update diagrams if you add new agent types, tools, or change architecture.
- **Changelog:** Update `CHANGELOG.md` for all significant changes.
- **Linting & Error Checking:**
  - After editing any file, always run lint/type checks and fix errors before proceeding.
  - Use the `get_errors` tool after every file edit.
  - If you add or change a tool, validate its registration and schema.
- **If in doubt:** Ask for more context or check this README and the codebase structure.
- **Self-Reminder:**
  - Always gather context before making changes.
  - Prefer semantic search for codebase exploration.
  - Never assume tool registration—verify in `tools/index.ts`.
  - Document all new patterns and integrations here for future reference.

---

## Additional AI Assistant Guidance (2025-04-15)

- **Provider Support:**
  - This workspace now fully supports Google, Vertex AI, OpenAI, and Anthropic as LLM providers. Provider configuration is strictly validated with Zod schemas in `provider.utils.ts`.
  - Model instantiation is robust and type-safe, using the correct provider instance pattern for @ai-sdk/openai and @ai-sdk/anthropic. See `model.utils.ts` for details.
- **Type Safety:**
  - All provider and model config types are exported from `config.types.ts` and `provider.utils.ts` for downstream use.
  - Tool schemas are always patched and validated at registration in `tools/index.ts`.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Lint and type errors must be checked after every file edit. Use the `get_errors` tool or your IDE's diagnostics.
  - If you encounter a provider/model/tool registration error, check the README and the relevant config files for patterns and best practices.
- **Windows Context:**
  - This workspace is developed and tested on Windows. File paths, scripts, and environment variables may use Windows conventions.
- **Changelog Discipline:**
  - All significant changes must be documented in `CHANGELOG.md` with a date and version. See the latest entry for format.
- **AI Assistant Self-Reminder:**
  - Always gather context before making changes.
  - Prefer semantic search for codebase exploration.
  - Never assume tool registration—verify in `tools/index.ts`.
  - Document all new patterns and integrations here for future reference.
  - Lint and type errors must be checked after every file edit. Use the `get_errors` tool or your IDE's diagnostics.
  - If you encounter a provider/model/tool registration error, check the README and the relevant config files for patterns and best practices.
